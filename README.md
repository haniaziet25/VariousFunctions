	Input: one or more words (eg. Dog/Dog is jumping)
Shift+{F3} and selected sentence/word or a caret in the middle of a word
	Output: Alters the first or all letters
EXAMPLES:
	Dog is jumping -> DOG IS JUMPING
	Dog -> DOG
	DOG IS JUMPING -> dog is jumping
	DOG -> dog
	dog is jumping -> Dog is jumping
	dog -> Dog
Shifts caret to the end.
It works everywhere exept Word, because in Word Application this function already exists.
